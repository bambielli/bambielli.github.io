I'm a Seattle native living in Chicago, currently working at [Expedia][expedia]{:target="_blank"} as a Software Engineer & FrontEnd Tech Lead for our product. I've worked for organizations that range from Fortune 500 to 8 person startup.

With formative background in engineering, and expertise in Software & Process Quality, I'm constantly looking for ways to leverage my technical skills to help others and contribute to meaningful projects.
