I'm a Seattle native living in Chicago, currently working at [Uptake][uptake]{:target="_blank"} as a Senior Software Engineer.

I'm also volunteering as a Teaching Assistant for the first cohort of the Northwestern University [Web Development Bootcamp][bootcamp]{:target="_blank"}.

With a formative background in engineering, and expertise in software quality and agile methodologies, I'm constantly looking for ways to leverage my technical skills to help others and contribute to meaningful projects.
