I'm a Seattle native living in Chicago, currently working at [Flexport][flexport]{:target="_blank"} as an engineering manager on the Trucking team. We manage the [Transmission][trans] web and mobile applications, which help carriers effectively manage their fleets via real time GPS data and delivery statuses.

With a formative background in engineering, and expertise in software quality and agile methodologies, I'm constantly looking for ways to leverage my technical skills to teach others and contribute to meaningful projects.
