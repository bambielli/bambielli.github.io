I'm a Seattle native living in Chicago, currently working at People Analytics firm [Syndio][syndio]{:target="_blank"} as a Software Developer. I've worked for organizations that range in size from Fortune 500 to 10 person startup.

With a strong engineering background and expertise in Software & Process Quality, I'm constantly looking for ways to leverage my technical skills to help others and contribute to meaningful projects.
