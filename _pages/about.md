The last few years have been full of change: I moved from Chicago back to Seattle, got married, bought a house, and my wife and I just welcomed a daughter to our family.

Professionally things have also been moving quickly: my team at Flexport grew from 5 to 10 engineers, then from 10 to 40 over a 9 month period of hypergrowth. And more recently, I finally took the leap to join [BusGenius][bg]{:target="_blank"} full time as CTO. Our mission is simple - we fix bus bunching! But beyond that we work closely with our customers to provide unmatched tech-enabled experiences for riders, drivers, and managers of transit systems alike.
