Hello. My name is Brian Ambielli.
I'm a Seattle native living in Chicago, currently working at People Analytics firm [Syndio][syndio] as a Software Developer. With a strong engineering background and expertise in Software & Process Quality, I'm looking for ways to leverage my technical skills while contributing to meaningful projects.

I've worked for organizations that range in size from fortune 500 to 10 person startup.
I can be counted on to make strategic decisions, then go off and implement them.
