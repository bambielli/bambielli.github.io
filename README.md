This is the repository for my personal website.

It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It is implemented using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) framework.

It is styled with the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/).

Check out the issue log to see what I'm considering writing about / working on next.
