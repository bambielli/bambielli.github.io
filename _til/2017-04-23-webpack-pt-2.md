TIL how to configure `webpack-dev-server` (WDS) to both serve files from the publicPath and proxy APIs on different domains to avoid cross site request warnings in the browser.

[Click here for my previous TIL on paths and naming in webpack.][previous]{:target="_blank"}

This post will focus on setting up `WDS` and some of the configuration options I wound up using.

The following gist is the webpack config I will reference throughout this post. **NOTE: I am using [webpack 2][wp2]{:target="_blank"} so the config might look slightly different if you're used to webpack 1 config:**

### The `devServer.contentBase` Option

Per the documentation, the [devServer.contentBase][cb]{:target="_blank"} option tells the dev server where content should be served from. In other words, if there is anything static that the devServer should be serving (like other generated code that is served as part of your build steps) it should be located at the `contentBase`. 

`contentBase` can be an array, so there can be multiple locations in your file system that make up the devServer's contentBase if necessary.

I used `contentBase` to point my devServer to some static files that were generated during a build step for our app. Unlike the bundled files served from publicPath, **the files served from contentBase do not change during development**, and therefore do not need to be served from publicPath. 

I don't know if this is "best practice" or not, but I found it worked for me :)

### The `devServer.proxy` option

The whole reason I started this re-tooling process was to get to WDS proxies, and here it finally is!

The [`proxy`][proxy]{:target="_blank"} option allows you to specify a path that, when a request is made to WDS with that path, the server will forward the request to the target in the configuration. 

So from my configuration example above: my `devServer.proxy` object contains a key `'/api2'`, which itself contains a target mapping of `https://new-api-domain.com`. My dev server is configured to run at `https://localhost:8445` NOTE: the `devServer.https` option is set to `true` in my configuration above, so my devServer will use a self-signed certificate to feign an https connection (you can also provide your own if needed). 

Any requests made to `https://localhost:8445/api2` will be proxied to `https://new-api-domain.com/api2`, **which allows me to send requests to the domain where my app originated and get data from a different one.** Pretty nifty!

You might also be asking yourself: *what if my other domain doesn't have a route of `/api2`?* Well you're in luck, because WDS allows you to pass a `pathRewrite` option to your proxy mapping, in which you can pass a regex to match on the mapped path and change it to a different one that makes sense for your new domain (see configuration above).

One final trick that `proxy` does, is it can proxy requests to https domains that have broken certificates! Just set the `secure` option to `false`, and your requests will resolve with no problem.

This wasn't the end of my webpack learnings: I also worked on loader and plugin configuration to transpile our `.jsx` files to ES5 and extract our CSS from the main webpack bundles into their own files to reduce the main bundle size. Stay tuned for the next installment!
