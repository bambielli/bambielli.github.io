TIL how to configure `webpack-dev-server` (WDS) to both serve files from the publicPath and proxy APIs on different domains to avoid cross site request warnings in the browser.

[Click here for my previous TIL on paths and naming in webpack.][previous]{:target="_blank"}

This post will focus on setting up `WDS` and some of the configuration options I wound up using. 

WDS works by holding your bundled files *in memory* on the dev server. **This allows for the quick diffing and serving of changes to application assets as they change during development.** WDS "stores" these files at the `output.publicPath`.

The following gist is the webpack config I will reference throughout this post. **NOTE: I am using [webpack 2][wp2]{:target="_blank"} so the config might look slightly different if you're used to webpack 1 config:**

### The `devServer.contentBase` Option

Yet another `path` related configuration optionâ€¦ what makes this one different from `path` and `publicPath` (which were covered in my last blog post)?

Per the documentation, the [devServer.contentBase][cb]{:target="_blank"} option tells the dev server where content should be served from. In other words, if there are any files that the `devServer` should reference from disk (like other generated code as part of your build steps) it should be located at the `contentBase`. 

`contentBase` can be an array, so there can be multiple locations in your file system that make up the devServer's contentBase if necessary.

In my case, I used `contentBase` to point my devServer to some static locale files that were generated during a build step for our app. Unlike the bundled files served from `publicPath`, **the locale files served from contentBase do not change during development**, and therefore do not need to be held in memory on the dev server. They can be referenced directly from disk at the `contentBase`.

**A pro-tip I learned:** if there aren't any HTML files configured to be served from `/` on the devServer, if you access the base path directly you can see the files currently being stored at `contentBase`. If you want to see files being reference at `publicPath` (in other words, files held in memory on the dev server and not written to disk), navigate to `/webpack-dev-server`! 

**Also, a word of warning:** It appears that if a file with the same path && name exists at both the `contentBase` and the `publicPath`, **that the contentBase version will be preferentially served by the devServer.** I discovered this when I had an old `bundle.min.js` at the `contentBase` while I was debugging my configuration, and changed the `publicPath` to be the same as my `contentBase`. Changes that I made to files in my bundle were not being reflected in the browser, even through a hard refresh of the page.

### The `devServer.proxy` option

The whole reason I started this re-tooling process was to get to WDS proxies... the moment is finally here! 

The [`proxy`][proxy]{:target="_blank"} option allows you to specify a path that, when a request is made to WDS with that path, the server will forward the request to the target in the configuration. 

So from my configuration example above: my `devServer.proxy` object contains a key `'/api2'`, which itself contains a target mapping of `https://new-api-domain.com`. My dev server is configured to run at `https://localhost:8445` NOTE: the `devServer.https` option is set to `true` in my configuration above, so my devServer will use a self-signed certificate to feign an https connection (you can also provide your own if needed). 

Any requests made to `https://localhost:8445/api2` will be proxied to `https://new-api-domain.com/api2`, **which allows me to send requests to the domain where my app originated and get data from a different one.** Pretty nifty!

You might also be asking yourself: *what if my other domain doesn't have a route of `/api2`?* Well you're in luck, because WDS allows you to pass a `pathRewrite` option to your proxy mapping, in which you can pass a regex to match on the mapped path and change it to a different one that makes sense for your new domain (see configuration above).

One final trick that `proxy` does, is it can proxy requests to https domains that have broken certificates! Just set the `secure` option to `false`, and your requests will resolve with no problem.

This wasn't the end of my webpack learnings: I also worked on loader and plugin configuration to transpile our `.jsx` files to ES5 and extract our CSS from the main webpack bundles into their own files to reduce the main bundle size. Stay tuned for the next installment!
