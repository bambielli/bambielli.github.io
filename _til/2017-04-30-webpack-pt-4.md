TIL how to use webpack plugins like `ExtractTextPlugin` and `CommonsChunkPlugin` to gain further granularity in my webpack bundles.

[Click here for my previous TIL on webpack loaders.][previous]{:target="_blank"}

[Webpack plugins][plugins]{:target="_blank"} aim to fill in the gaps for what other loaders cannot accomplish.

The following gist contains the webpack config I will reference throughout this post.

### Configuring Plugins

Plugins are added under the `plugins` top level key in your webpack config. The plugins key is set to an array of the plugins to be used by webpack. You can add additional plugins to the array based on environment (like Uglify in production). Plugins are installed via NPM like any other package, and should be saved as dev dependencies.

The plugins I added to my project were used to further separate my main bundle in to smaller chunks separated both by file-type and caching potential.

### The CommonsChunkPlugin

The `CommonsChunkPlugin` is an opt-in feature that comes with webpack, so it doesnâ€™t need to be installed via npm. It is used to **detect common code shared between entry points in your app** and split that common code out into a separate bundle. This is useful for performance, as common code can be cached by the browser instead of re-downloaded with each new bundle. 

It can also be used to bundle vendor files together into its own bundle. This is the use case in my config above: the modules referenced by the vendor entry point is split out into their own bundle called `vendor.min.js`. This way, common vendor code which is unlikely to change is separated from my main application bundle, and can be cached long term by the browser.

This both **reduces the size of my application bundle,** which allows for parallel loading by the browser on initial page visit, and allows for **long term browser caching** of vendor code that is not likely to change. 

The most important property of the CommonsChunkPlugin config is the `minChunks` property: **this property defines the minimum number of chunks which need to contain a module before it is moved in to the common bundle.** In the case of vendor above, we define `minChunks` to be `Infinity`, which prevents webpack from moving any additional modules besides the modules referenced in the vendor entry point into the vendor bundle. This config make sense in this context, since we want to ensure our vendor bundle only contains vendor code.

The `CommonsChunkPlugin` config above results in a bundle named vendor.min.js that is accessible at the public path at `/assets/js/vendor.min.js` and contains code for the react library.

### ExtractTextPlugin

The `ExtractTextPlugin` is used to extract .less or .css files into their own bundle. By default, `.css` and `.less` files required by your modules **will be inlined in the same bundle as the rest of your application code.** This is undesirable: ideally we would have our CSS in a separate file from our JS code so we can keep our bundles small and can leverage parallel loading in the browser.

The plugin is instantiated with the name of the file we'd like our extracted code to be moved to (accessible at the public path). In the example config above, our code will be available at `/assets/css/[name].min.css`. The CSS extracted from an entry point bundle **will have the same name as the entry point bundle itself**: e.g. `bundle.min.css` for the css extracted from `bundle.min.js`.

In the loader config, we use the `extract` method of the plugin to configure which loaders should be used by the plugin before the CSS is extracted in to its own bundle. In our case, this includes the chain of `css-loader!less-loader` since we are dealing with `.less` stylesheets in our app.

In addition to extracting CSS that is required by application code, **the plugin can be used to create a bundle for other globally referenced stylesheets that are not explicitly required by js modules in your bundle.** 

In the config above, one of our entry points is just called 'global-css'. This entry point points to a `.less` file that is loaded globally, but is not loaded via a require statement in any of our js modules. The result of this addition is two files: one called `js/global-css.min.js` and the other `css/global-css.min.css`. Behind the scenes, **webpack is creating a JS bundle for our CSS file** (the global-css.min.js file) and then the ExtractTextPlugin is extracting the CSS from that bundle in to a standalone CSS file. 

The global-css.min.js bundle will never be requested by the client, and is just a necessary evil of the ExtractTextPlugin process. 

### Keeping Configuration Consistent Across Environments

By using the CommonsChunkPlugin and ExtractTextPlugin, we were able to keep our entry HTML template lean, without any environment specific configuration that changed based on dev vs prod environments. Our config to create bundles for development is now almost identical to our config for prod (we add additional plugins for minification and obfuscation for prod). This leads to better dev/prod parity, and a single source of truth for webpack configuration in our application.

Stay tuned for a final post about some of the differences between Webpack 1 and 2.
