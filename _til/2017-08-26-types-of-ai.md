TIL about the 6 different branches of AI.

I started my first class of the [Georgia Tech OMSCS][OMSCS]{:target="_blank"} program this week: Artificial Intelligence. While I took an AI class at Northwestern during my graduate studies, the GT class covers the full scope of my Northwestern class within the first 3 weeks.

The textbook for the class is [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach][amzn]{:target="_blank"} by Norvig and Russell. Chapter 1 covered the history of Artificial Intelligence, as well as how the fields of mathematics, economics, and even linguistics have had their impact on the discipline.

## 6 Branches of AI

Chapter 1 also covered the 6 different branches of AI.

- **Natural language processing** - the ability for a computer to parse and produce language - *communication*
- **Knowledge Representation** - the ability for a computer to store and retain what it knows. It should also be able to fit new knowledge it acquires in to this storage - *memory*
- **Automated Reasoning** - The ability for a computer to use its acquired knowledge to answer questions and draw conclusions - *intelligence*
- **Machine Learning** - the ability for a computer to detect patterns in data, and adapt to new scenarios on its own - *learning / growing*
- **Computer Vision** - the ability for a computer to perceive objects in its surroundings - *perception*
- **Robotics** - The ability for a computer to manipulate objects, and move itself through space - *motor function*

A computer agent with mastery of all 6 branches could pass the [Total Turing Test][fullT]{:target="_blank"}, and would in theory be indistinguishable from a human agent.

I'm looking forward to studying and implementing AI systems over the next semester!
