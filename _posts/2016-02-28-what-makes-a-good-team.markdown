An article recently published by the *New York Times Magazine* highlighted research efforts by Google to answer the question __"What Makes the Perfect Team?"__

A good team elevates the capabilities of its members, while a bad team has quite the opposite effect: productivity decreases and employee well-being begins to suffer. The article resonated with me quite a bit as it articulated thoughts I have had while working on various teams throughout my career.

### Culture of "Psychological Safety"

The key finding was that groups should aim to develop a culture that promotes __psychological safety__, wherein group members feel __comfortable to take risks and speak up__ without the concern of being punished or rejected. This group culture puts team members at ease, increases their sense of worth both in and outside of work, and fosters both creativity and productivity within the group.

Psychologically safe employees are comfortable __being themselves at work,__ and consequently feel more engaged while working. These feelings of security are encouraged by getting to know teammates on a more personal level, developing empathy and understanding for one another in the process. Sharing lunch with co-workers shouldn't be seen as a waste of time in this sense, but should be advocated for as a worthwhile *investment* towards group culture!

Group behaviors that are indicative of a psychologically safe group culture are:

1) Group members speak (roughly) the same amount during team meetings, and no one talks over one another.
2) A high level of social sensitivity (empathy) of group members.

### Make or Break Decision for Employee Engagement

I have *absolutely* experienced the consequences of being on teams with a psychologically __un__safe culture: you feel drained at the end of the day and work more in isolation since seeking out feedback leads to being rebuked for "incorrect" (read *"different"*) decisions. Feelings of inadequacy and self doubt are common, although illogical.

It's interesting how much team culture can affect an employee's general sentiment about their workplace: __which team you're placed on can make or break your experience at a company.__

What's *more* interesting is that an employee often has very little input on their team placement. Managers assign employees to project teams based on *availability*, not based on objective evidence that the selected members will work well together.

If an employee doesn't click with the culture of their assigned team, it could be perceived by a manager as a failure of the employee to assimilate. This may discourage employees from speaking up about a potentially bad fit, which is exactly the opposite behavior managers should encourage.

### People Analytics

A people analytics platform such as [Syndio's][Syndio]{:target="_blank"} can help take the guesswork out of composing new groups. Equipped with network knowledge of their workforce and metrics around which employees are good listeners, leaders, innovators and change agents, managers can make more strategic choices that increase the likelihood of creating a psychologically safe group culture when forming new teams. This knowledge is invaluable for mission critical projects that cannot afford to be impeded by a dysfunctional group.

[Syndio's][Syndio]{:target="_blank"} platform also detects which groups have lower than average workplace sentiment, indicating a group with potential culture issues. Red flags such as these enable managers to detect struggling teams earlier and course correct as needed.

People analytics will provide the data necessary to make *smarter* decisions when choosing who works together. __This will ultimately lead to more productive groups (employer benefit) and satisfied group members (employee benefit).__
