I read an article recently published by the New York Times[1] that highlighted research efforts by Google that aimed to determine what makes the perfect team. A "good" team can elevate the capabilities of its members, while a "bad" team has the opposite effect: productivity decreases and employee satisfaction starts dropping. The article resonated with me quite a bit as it articulated thoughts I have had while working on various teams throughout my career.

The key finding was that __groups should aim to develop a culture of psychological safety__, wherein group members feel safe to take risks and speak up within the group without the concern of being punished or rejected for their risk taking. *This group culture was found to put team members at ease, increase their sense of well being both in and outside of work, and foster creativity / productivity within groups.*

Psychologically safe people __feel comfortable being themselves at work__, which is encouraged by connecting with co-workers and teammates on a more personal level. Taking lunchbreaks to small talk with co-workers shouldn't be seen as a waste of time in this sense, but should be advocated for by managers as a worthwhile investment in group culture.

Group behaviors that are indicative of a culture of psychological safety are:

1) Group members speak (roughly) the same amount during team meetings, and no one talks over one another.
2) A high level of social sensitivity (empathy) between group members.

I have *absolutely* experienced the consequences of being on teams with a psychologically unsafe culture: you feel drained at the end of the day, work more in isolation since seeking out feedback leads to being rebuked for "incorrect" (read *"different"*) decisions, and are overcome with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.

It's interesting how much team culture can affect an employee's overall workplace sentiment: __the choice of the team that you're placed on can make or break your experience at a company.__

What makes it *more* interesting is that an employee often has very little input on their team assignments. Managers assign employees to project teams based on *availability*, not based on objective evidence that the selected members will work well together.

If an employee doesn't click with the culture of their assigned team, it could be perceived by a manager as a failure of the employee to assimilate. This discourages employees from speaking up about a potentially bad fit.

This is exactly the __wrong__ behavior that managers want, though. They should want to identify which teams do NOT work well together and intervene, since it not only affects employee satisfaction but team productivity as well.

__This is something that the Syndio platform can help with:__ for mission critical initiatives that cannot afford a poorly functioning team, *managers can use knowledge of their employee network to make more informed decisions on team composition.*

Our platform also detects which groups have lower than average workplace sentiment, potentially highlighting a group with bad dynamics. This helps managers determine which of their groups might need some re-structuring or individual coacing.
