TIL that you can quickly navigate to the beginning and end of a command in the command line by using the shortcuts ctrl+A and ctrl+E.

- ctrl+A sets the cursor to the beginning of a command
- ctrl+E sets the cursor to the end of a command

This is useful if you are typing a long command and want to change something at the beginning without having to left arrow through the entire command.
