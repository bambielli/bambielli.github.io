One of the missing components from the curriculum of the bootcamp at which I teach, is a day on agile methodologies and how agile is typically implemented on software teams. I decided to remedy this with a short presentation for class. Slides within!

Intended audience is someone who has never been introduced to agile methodologies or their implementation. The goal is to gain enough familiarity with the core concepts, that the person wouldn't feel totally alien on an agile team.

If you're on mobile, you can download the slides [here.][slides]{:target="_blank"}
