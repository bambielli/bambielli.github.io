I've been learning a lot about Webpack recently (check my [TIL section][til] for more detail) and I decided to give a presentation at Expedia's frontEnd engineering community of practice to share my experience. Slides are included in this post!

With Webpack 2 coming out of beta last February, I figured the Star Trek reference would be appropriate :)

[Find the sample repository here][sample]{:target="_blank"}, which includes a PDF of the slides.
