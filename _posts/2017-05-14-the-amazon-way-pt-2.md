This is part 2 of my reflection on ["The Amazon Way"][amzn]{:target="_blank"} by John Rossman.

Check out my thoughts on [principles 1-7 here][pt1] if you haven't already.

## 8. Have a Bias for Action
  - **Most decisions are reversible**
    - Acting is better than sitting still, especially in the presence uncertainty.
  - Smart decisions are made with data.
    - Having the right data at the right time will allow you to act faster than the competition.

## 9. Practice Frugality
  - **Resource constrained environments promote resourceful and innovative ideas.**
  - "The Door Desk" - Desks are often made of old doors or particle board at Amazon.
    - Door desks were shipped to Europe for a new office... Jeff blew up.
    - Door desks are not a symbol, they are a practical way to save money.
  - Compensate with stock instead of salary.
    - This Makes employees more invested in business outcomes.

## 10. Be Vocally Self-Critical
  - "Open Kimono" policy
    - Everyone shares their mistakes with the organization so mistakes won't be repeated.
  - The best leaders are those with **"a blend of humility and will"**
    - humble enough to admit they don't know it all, but with the persistence to stay the course in the face of adversity.

## 11. Earn the Trust of Others
  - The "Two Pizza" team
    - Not as much about size, the spirit of the "Two Pizza" team is that the business should entrust small groups (6-10 people) with the autonomy to explore and innovate on their own.
  - Six keys to earning trust of your team
    1. **Open your kimono** - share your mistakes with the team
    2. **Take responsibility** when the team fails
    3. **Build up your team members** - especially in public forums
    4. **Ditch the leash** - give your team autonomy to make decisions on their own
    5. **Accept confrontation** - this is a sign that your team isn't afraid to voice their opinions
    6. **Find the value in each person**

## 12. Dive Deep
  - Jeff has banned Powerpoint in favor of the "deep dive" essay summary
    - This technique forces the writer to dive deeper into an idea, instead of skimming the surface with high lever bullet points.
    - **This is the reason why I like blogging:** writing about technical concepts in blog format forces me to dive deeper into a concept than I often would when encountering it at work. It forces a deeper clarity of thinking, which helps with retention of the concept.
  - The "Five Whys" technique
    - Ask "why" five times when you encounter an issue to reach root cause.
    - This technique is a popular Quality Management System practice during the Corrective Action / Preventative Action process.

## 13. Have a Backbone - Disagree and Commit
  - **Tenacity and perseverance** are better indicators of someone's likelihood to be successful than talent or skill.
  - Mental toughness - Don't feel sorry for yourself, resent othersâ€™ successes, or give up after failure.

## 14. Deliver Results
  - This is truly the principle which matters most.
    - Following the other principles should make this easy to achieve!

## Conclusion

It has been interesting exploring and reflecting on these principles. Many of the `-isms` contained in this book are referenced by my manager at Expedia, and I didn't realize they originated from his tenure at Amazon!

While following these principles will certainly lead to a higher probability of success for your business, full adoption requires a level of employee sacrifice that many organizations aren't willing to impose.

During a recent town hall at Expedia, someone raised the question **"Why don't we choose to operate more like Amazon?"** The response from leadership was deliberate: Expedia is inspired by Amazon's level of dedication and focus that they've inspired in their employees, but Expedia aims to achieve success in our space without an Amazonian-level of sacrifice. **Expedia values work-life balance instead of the cutthroat "live to work" culture that has grown at Amazon.**

Hearing that this was a deliberate choice was surprising, and I think the effects are apparent. While there is a ton of schedule flexibility at Expedia (a great benefit for employees) it does often feel that we operate at a slower pace than we otherwise could. Bureaucracy seems to be creeping in, especially as the organization has grown with recent acquisitions.

Being aware of these 14 principles -- using their lessons to combat bureaucracy and drive value for the business -- will make me a stronger contributor to my team and a more tactical decision maker in our org.

I definitely recommend "The Amazon Way" to anyone interested in learning how one of the most significant and disruptive companies of our time operates.
