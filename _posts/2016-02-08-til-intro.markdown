TIL stands for "Today I Learned," and I believe the concept originated from the subreddit [/r/TodayILearned][til]{:target="_blank"}.

A TIL is a small snippet describing something you learned that day. It shouldn't be too long, but should include enough detail so someone else can understand the concept after reading.

The inspiration to make a TIL section for my blog comes from a post I saw the other day on [Hacker News][show-hn]{:target="_blank"}. The author has been writing TILs for a little over a year, committing them to a github repository. Posts are organized in topic folders, and are written in markdown so they are easy to view and digest via github. I love this idea, but instead of creating a new repository I figure I'd just create a new section of my site.

I'm hoping a mechanism like this will get me to push more frequent content, as well as reinforce technical concepts that I'm learning each so I am less prone to forget!
