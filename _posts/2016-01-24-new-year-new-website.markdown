I figured it's about time I set up a personal website!

It also couldn't be easier with [Jekyll][jekyll]{:target="_blank"} powered Github static pages. I didn't know anything about Jekyll until this weekend, and now I'm hooked. This blog is generated with entirely client side code, served from my [github static page repo][github-page]{:target="_blank"}. "Deploying" a new post is as easy as a commit and a push. Its simplicity inspired me to finally register bambielli.com and put something on it.

I plan on using this site to:

  * Comment on life as a Software Developer at [Syndio][syndio]{:target="_blank"}, where I have been employed for almost a year.
  * Record thoughts on books that I finish reading: I just finished [Thinking Fast and Slow][thinking-fast]{:target="_blank"} by Daniel Kahneman.
  * Write about challenges in the classroom, as I continue to volunteer as an AP Computer Science teacher at a Chicagoland High School.
  * Discuss any side-projects I'm currently working on, and lessons learned from those.
  * Follow through on New Years resolutions. This is one of them :)

Hope you'll join me! In the meantime, check out my [github][github]{:target="_blank"} or connect with me on [Linkedin][linkedin]{:target="_blank"}.
