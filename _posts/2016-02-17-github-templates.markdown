TIL that github now supports [templates][templates]{:target="_blank"} for both Issues and Pull Requests.

Since our team essentially lives in github, This is huge for us.

All it takes is creating a new PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md and ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md in to either the root of repository or to a new .github folder in root, and new pull requests and issues that are opened will use the appropriate one.

Supposedly this is the first of many updates to github tools that are soon to release, so stay tuned!
