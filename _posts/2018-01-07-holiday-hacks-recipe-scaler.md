Over the holidays, I created a [chrome extension][git]{:target="_blank"} that allows a user to dynamically adjust the number of servings for a recipe they are preparing. The extension works for recipes on [halfbakedharvest.com][hbh]{:target="_blank"}

The extension will scale ingredient amounts in the browser, based on the selected number of servings.

Scaling recipes has always been annoying to me... if I try to do it by hand or in my head, I will either not scale by the correct factors or I will forget to scale an ingredient while checking back with the recipe.

The recipe-scaler removes this point of friction, so you can focus on cooking instead of on (surprisingly tricky) math.

You can check out a **live demo of the scaler in action here**: [www.bambielli.com/recipe-scaler/][demo]{:target="_blank"}

And see the **source code** here: [www.github.com/bambielli/recipe-scaler/][git]{:target="_blank"}
