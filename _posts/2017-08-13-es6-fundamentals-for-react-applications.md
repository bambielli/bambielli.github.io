Don't worry about learning all of the new features introduced in the ES6 spec, **just focus on these core ones that are used most frequently in React codebases!**

## Topics To Learn

The ES6 features any aspiring React dev should learn are:

- [let][let]{:target="_blank"} vs. [const][const]{:target="_blank"}
- [template literals][template]{:target="_blank"}
- [string interpolation][interp]{:target="_blank"}
- [arrow functions][arrow]{:target="_blank"}
- [ES6 classes][classes]{:target="_blank"}
- [destructuring assignments][dest]{:target="_blank"}
- [spread operator][spread]{:target="_blank"}

These features were chosen based on my experience building React applications over the past several years.

## Cheat Sheet

I've created a cheat sheet with examples and explanations of the features above. It is executable in a node environment, feel free to fork it and add to it if you think there's anything I've forgotten.

Find a gist with the cheat sheet here: [https://gist.github.com/bambielli/25dd9778f286fe04338092c87b145fc2][gist]{:target="_blank"}
