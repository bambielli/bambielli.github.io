Wow, what a week! I had the privilege of attending [Denver Startup Week (DSW)][dsw]{:target="_blank"} as part of the second cohort of the [Ambassadors program][ambassadors]{:target="_blank"}.

## What is the Ambassadors Program?

The ambassadors program flies in founders, engineers, and business leaders from all over the country to tour Denver startups and get a feel for the city. Local startups sponsor the program so ambassadors don't have to worry about costs for the week (which was amazing).

The programming was equally fantastic: our group of ambassadors had **intimate conversations with executives** from [Evolve Vacation Rentals][evolve]{:target="_blank"}, [Guild Education][guild]{:target="_blank"}, [Gusto][gusto]{:target="_blank"}, and [Ibotta][ibotta]{:target="_blank"}. We toured their offices, and learned about some of the ways that Denver has played a part in their startups' journeys.

The other startup ambassadors in the program were inspiring: I learned as much speaking with them as I did from attending DSW programming throughout the week. **I now have an extended network of 50 technology leaders across the country**, each coming from very diverse backgrounds and practices. I feel privileged to have been given the opportunity to attend DSW and connect with members of startup, venture capital, design, consulting and business development communities across the US.

I can’t recommend the program enough, and I’d be happy to chat more about my experience with anyone who is interested! Denver has an impressive startup scene, and is on my radar of places to consider moving to in the medium term.
